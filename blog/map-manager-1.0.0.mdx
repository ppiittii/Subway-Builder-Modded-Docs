You can download the latest release of the Subway Builder Map Manager at: https://github.com/Kronifer/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases/tag/v1.0.0. Update your Map Manager before proceeding with any guide.

### Changelog:

#### Features:
 - Install mods from a zip file (or multiple at once!)
 - Autogenerate thumbnails (if your map creator supports it)
 - Country tabs if added by the map creator (currently nonfunctional on US and UK maps until more API methods are added)
 - Auto-management of map tiles. No more serve.ps1 or serve.sh!
 - Handles installation of maps into the game. No install scripts! Just enable the mod in-game and you're done!

### Fixes and Changes from the last beta:
 - Fixed an issue where the manager would crash if a user cancelled selecting paths during first run
 - The manager now checks if the AppData folder you selected matches the format of the actual games data files to prevent accidental selection of incorrect folders
 - Catches more crashes and errors to avoid the infamous infinite load
