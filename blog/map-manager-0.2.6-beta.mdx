You can download the latest release of the Subway Builder Map Manager at: https://github.com/Kronifer/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases/tag/v0.2.6-beta. Update your Map Manager before proceeding with any guide.

### Changelog:
 - Fixes an issue where mods couldn't be removed from the manager if the files were manually deleted
 - PMTiles is now bundled in at buildtime to prevent issues where it couldn't be downloaded. This should also maybe hopefully finally fix my war with MacOS
