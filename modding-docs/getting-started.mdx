This guide walks you through setting up your first Subway Builder mod using the community TypeScript template.

:::note Prerequisites
Before you start, you should have a basic grasp of **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. If you've never written JS/TS before, we recommend working through a beginner tutorial first — the modding API is straightforward, but you do need to understand variables, functions, and basic syntax.

You'll also need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22 or later
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Subway Builder](https://subwaybuilder.com) v1.1.0 or later
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
  :::

## Step 1 - Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/SubwayBuilderTemplateMod.git my-mod
cd my-mod
```

## Step 2 - Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs the build toolchain (Vite/Rolldown, TypeScript, etc.). The game's APIs are accessed at runtime — there's no SDK package to install.

## Step 3 - Configure Your Mod

Edit `manifest.json` with your mod's identity:

```json
{
  "id": "com.yourname.yourmod",
  "name": "My Cool Mod",
  "description": "Does something cool",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "Your Name" },
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

The `id` should be a unique reverse-domain identifier. The `main` field should always be `"index.js"` — that's what the build outputs.

## Step 4 - Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This compiles your TypeScript + React code into a single `dist/index.js` file, and copies `manifest.json` into `dist/`.

## Step 5 - Link to the Game

```bash
pnpm dev:link
```

This creates a symlink from `dist/` to the game's mods folder. The mods folder location depends on your OS:

| OS          | Path                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**   | `~/Library/Application Support/metro-maker4/mods/` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\metro-maker4\mods\`                     |
| **Linux**   | `~/.config/metro-maker4/mods/`                     |

The symlink means every time you rebuild, the game sees your latest code without you copying files.

:::tip
On Windows, you may need to run your terminal as Administrator for the symlink to work.

## Step 6 - Enable Your Mod

1. Launch Subway Builder
2. Go to **Settings > Mods**
3. Toggle your mod **on**
4. Restart the game (or load a city)

You should see your mod's log messages in the game's developer console.

## Step 7 - Development Workflow

For active development, use the `dev` command which watches for file changes and launches the game with logging:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs two processes simultaneously:

- **Vite watcher** — rebuilds on every file save
- **Game launcher** — starts Subway Builder with logging to `debug/latest.log`

After making changes, reload mods in-game with **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to see your updates without restarting the game.

## Step - 8 Unlink When Done

To remove the symlink:

```bash
pnpm dev:unlink
```

## Available Scripts

| Command           | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm build`      | Build the mod to `dist/`              |
| `pnpm dev`        | Watch mode + launch game with logging |
| `pnpm dev:link`   | Symlink `dist/` to game's mods folder |
| `pnpm dev:unlink` | Remove the symlink                    |
| `pnpm typecheck`  | Run TypeScript type checking          |
