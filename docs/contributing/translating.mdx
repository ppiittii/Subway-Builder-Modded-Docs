This guide covers how to contribute translations to the Subway Builder Modded Wiki. Translators are responsible for ensuring their contributions are accurate, clear, and consistent with the original content. All contributions must follow proper grammar, maintain formatting, and be submitted via Pull Request (PR) for review.

:::important
Throughout this guide, YOUR_LOCALE_CODE will refer to the language you are working on. For example, for Spanish, it would be `es`. For English, it would be `en`. For a full list, look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp).
:::
## Contributing to an Existing Language {#contributing-to-an-existing-language}

If you want to contribute translations to a language that already exists in the project:

**1.** Navigate to the folder corresponding to your language in `i18n/YOUR_LOCALE_CODE`. For example, Spanish translations are located in `i18n/es`.
**2.** You are responsible for all files in this folder, including but not limited to:
 - `code.json`
 - `tags.yml`
 - Any other `.json` or `.yml` files
**3.** Ensure that all text is properly translated while keeping the formatting intact (headings, lists, code blocks, notes, tips, admonitions, and images).
**4.** Do **not** attempt to translate the content from `/blogs`; these cannot be translated due to limitations in the framework. However, in the `docusaurus-plugin-content-blog` directory, there may be an `options.json`. This should be translated.
**5.** PR Requirements:
 - Any PR that anyone merges with the `needs-translating` tag must be translated into your language.  
 - Translation PRs must begin with the prefix `[Translation - YOUR_LOCALE_CODE]`.
**6.** Submit your changes via Pull Request. A wiki maintainer will review your submission before merging.

## Contributing a New Language {#contributing-a-new-language}

If you want to add a completely new language:

### Step 1 - Set Up Your Locale {#set-up-your-locale}

**1.** Open `docusaurus.config.js`.
**2.** Add your language to the `localeConfigs` section. Example:
```js
locales: ['en', 'es', 'fr', /* Add your language here */ 'it'],
localeConfigs: {
  en: {
    label: 'English',
    htmlLang: 'en-GB',
  },
  es: {
    label: 'Español',
    htmlLang: 'es-ES',
  },
  fr: {
    label: 'Français',
    htmlLang: 'fr-FR',
  },
  // Add your language below
  it: {
    label: 'Italiano',
    htmlLang: 'it-IT',
  },
},
```


**3.** Save the file.

### Step 2 - Generate Translation Folders {#generate-translation-folders}

Run the following command to generate a new translation scaffold:
```bash
npx docusaurus write-translations --locale YOUR_LOCALE_CODE
```


### Step 3 - Organize Your Translation Workspace {#organize-your-translation-workspace}

**1.** Inside `docusaurus-plugin-content-docs` and `docusaurus-plugin-content-modding-docs`, create a folder called `current`.
**2.** Copy all files from `docs/` and `modding-docs/` into their respective `current`.
**3.** Begin translating these files. Maintain the original formatting, including:
 - Headings
 - Lists
 - Code blocks
 - Notes (`:::note`)
 - Tips (`:::tip`)
 - Important warnings (`:::important`)
 - Images and captions
**4.** Translate all other files in the directory, such as `code.json` and `tags.yml`.
**5.** Remember that links, page IDs, names, and image references **should not be translated**.

### Step 4 - Submit Your PR {#submit-your-pr}

 - Once all files are translated, submit a Pull Request.  
 - A wiki maintainer will review your translation before it is merged.  
 - Keep in mind that your contribution is **responsible for everything** in your language’s folder.  
 - Ensure all translations are accurate, consistent, and maintain the original formatting.  
 - PRs for translations must start with `[Translation - YOUR_LOCALE_CODE]`.

## MDX & i18n Guide for Translators {#mdx-and-i18n-guide-for-translators}

Docusaurus uses `i18n` to manage translations, and our wiki uses MDX for enhanced formatting. Translators must understand both.

### Key Responsibilities {#key-responsibilities}

 - Translate all textual content in your language folder, including `code.json`, `tags.yml`, `.mdx` files, and any metadata.
 - Maintain all MDX formatting:
   - Page header (`id` and `title`) must remain unchanged except for translated titles.
   - Lists, headings, code blocks, and blockquotes must remain consistent.
   - Admonitions (notes, tips, important warnings):
```md
:::note
This is a note. You may translate the text inside.
:::
```

   - Images and captions: do not translate filenames or captions that reference proper names.
 - Page IDs, links, and file references must **not** be translated.
 - Follow proper grammar and spelling for your language.
 - All headings should be static. This means if you want to have `### Responsibilities`, it should instead be `### Responsibilities {#responsibilities}` (case sensitive). The actual heading names should be translated. The static anchors should not.

### MDX Example {#mdx-example}
```md
---
id: example-page
title: Example Page
---

## Heading {#heading}

Text content here.

:::tip
This is a tip for the user.
:::
```

 - All text inside MDX content can be translated, including admonitions, lists, and paragraphs.  
 - Do **not** translate anything inside code blocks, filenames, links, or IDs.
