Welcome to the complete Subway Builder Map Directory, the (almost) complete list of all of the custom maps that exist for [Subway Builder](https://subwaybuilder.com). These maps were all developed individually by members of the Subway Builder [community](https://discord.gg/HNSdgEgzvg), and the credits for each map are listed next to the link. If you need see something missing (including your own map) or incorrect, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/Subway-Builder-Modded-Docs/issues) and I will look at it as soon as time allows. For any additional assistance, you can ask any questions [here](https://discord.gg/HNSdgEgzvg).
