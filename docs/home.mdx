Welcome to the unofficial [Subway Builder](https://subwaybuilder.com) modding wiki — a community-maintained hub for custom maps and game modding. Everything here was built by members of the Subway Builder [community](https://discord.gg/HNSdgEgzvg). If you see something missing (including your own map or mod) or incorrect, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Subway-Builder-Modded/Subway-Builder-Modded-Docs/issues). For any additional help, you can ask questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HNSdgEgzvg).

### Maps
 - **[Map Directory](/wiki/maps/map-directory)**
 - **[Installation Guide](/wiki/maps/map-installation-guide)**
   - This is for maps that use [Kronifer's Map Manager](https://github.com/Kronifer/subwaybuilder-patcher/releases). If you are unsure, visit the Map Directory.
 - **[Installation Guide - Legacy](/wiki/maps/legacy-map-installation-guide)**
   - This is for maps that require a serve script. If you are unsure, visit the Map Directory.

### Modding
Build your own mods using the Subway Builder Modding API (v1.0.0). The template is TypeScript-based with Vite — you should have a basic grasp of JavaScript/TypeScript before diving in.

 - **[Getting Started](/modding-docs/getting-started)** — Set up the mod template, build, and link to the game
 - **[Project Structure](/modding-docs/project-structure)** — What each file in the template does
 - **[Common Patterns](/modding-docs/common-patterns)** — Hooks, UI panels, game state, building tracks
 - **[React Components](/modding-docs/react-components)** — Using the game's React, UI components, icons, and charts
 - **[Debugging](/modding-docs/debugging)** — Hot reload, error handling, dev workflow
 - **[Type Reference](/modding-docs/type-reference)** — How the TypeScript types are organized
